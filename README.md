<h1 align="left">Speech to Text Project with Unity and Hugging Face API</h1>
<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>

**Speech-to-Text Game** is a game that challenges players to pronounce English words displayed on the screen correctly. The objective is to collect as many points as possible within a 1-minute timeframe by accurately pronouncing the words. <br>

The game features a diverse set of Unity-based components, including: <br>
  **1. Countdown Timer**: A dynamic timer that keeps track of the 1-minute gameplay session. <br>
  **2. Point Collection**: A scoring system that rewards players for correctly pronouncing the displayed words. <br>
  **3. Loudness Detection**: The game utilizes the user's microphone input to assess the volume and accuracy of their pronunciation. <br>
  **4. Data Integration**: The game reads word data from a CSV file, allowing for the inclusion of a wide range of vocabulary. <br>

The project leverages the powerful Hugging Face API for the speech-to-text mechanism, which converts the user's spoken words into text for comparison with the displayed word. Additionally, the game utilizes the Bayat Games Free Platform Game Assets from the Unity Asset Store, providing a visually appealing and polished user experience. <br>
